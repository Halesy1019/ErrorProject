/* Create a small program that defines some fields. Try creating some illegal 
 field names and see what kind of error the compiler produces. Use the naming 
 rules and conventions as a guide. In the program you created, try leaving the fields 
 uninitialized and print out their values. Try the same with a local variable and see 
 what kind of compiler errors you can produce. Becoming familiar with common compiler 
 errors will make it easier to recognize bugs in your code. */
